# SoundProcessingP4

This code is a synthesiser made for sound processing mini project. The synthesiser can generate a sound with a specific frequency in three basic waveforms.
These basic waveforms are sinusoidal, square, and sawtooth waveforms.
The program can then apply two types of filters: a resonator filter and an equaliser filter.
These two filters can be turned on or off using the buttons on a GUI.

To make the program work there are a few steps:
1. Get the packages. All packages used are at the top of the file.
2. Run the file.
3. Insert different parameters for your sound. (OBS. Even if not used the cutoff frequency and the Resonance boxes need a value)

Extra recommendation. The sound can be quite loud with an amplitude of 1 so make the amplitude something like 0.1 or 0.01 to start off so the sound isn't earpiercingly loud.
